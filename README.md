Project 6: Static Node.js and Express Site (Tech Degree)

## Description

This project presents a portfolio of my recent work. The information about each project is stored in a JSON file. Using Node.js and Express, each get request is routed where needed. The requested page is created by calling the render method and passing it the name of the appropriate Pug template and any needed data.

(The project uses supplied CSS and JavaScript files and Pug templates.)
